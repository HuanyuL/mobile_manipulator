## Introduction
The **Mobile Manipulator** project is a robotic arm control software integrated with a mobile base for performing complex tasks in dynamic environments.

The goal of this project is to provide a platform that allows developers to interact with and control mobile manipulators for various tasks such as picking, moving, and placing objects.

## Features
- **Mobile base control**: Seamlessly move the manipulator in dynamic environments.
- **Manipulator arm control**: High precision arm control for a variety of manipulation tasks.
- **Path planning**: Efficient and customizable path planning algorithms.
- **Obstacle avoidance**: Integrated sensors to avoid obstacles in real-time.
- **Modular architecture**: Easily extendable for additional sensors, controllers, or actuators.

## Technologies
This project is built using the following technologies:
- **Programming languages**: Python, C++, ROS (Robot Operating System)
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: OpenCV, MoveIt!, TensorFlow (for AI components, if applicable)
- **Hardware dependencies**: UR5 robot arm, Turtlebot, LIDAR sensors

## Installation
To set up the Mobile Manipulator project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have ROS installed and hardware components set up.

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mobile-manipulator.git
cd mobile-manipulator
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
# Example for Python
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Example for ROS
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

### Build the project (if necessary)
```bash
catkin_make  # If using ROS, otherwise specify build instructions
```

## Usage
Once the project is set up, you can start the system and control the mobile manipulator.

### Run the main application:
```bash
# Example for ROS
roslaunch mobile_manipulator main.launch

# Example for Python script
python main.py
```

### Basic Commands
- **Move manipulator arm**: `[command to control arm]`
- **Navigate mobile base**: `[command to control base]`
- **Execute task**: `[task-related commands]`

## Configuration
This section provides information on how to configure the project, including tuning parameters, changing hardware drivers, or modifying algorithm settings.

- **Configuration files**: Configuration files are located in `config/` directory and can be modified for different hardware setups.
- **ROS parameter tuning**: 
    - Example:
    ```bash
    rosparam set /mobile_manipulator/speed 0.5
    ```

## Examples
Here are some examples of using the **Mobile Manipulator** in different scenarios:

1. **Basic movement**: Follow the instructions in `examples/basic_movement.md` to control the robot's basic movements.
2. **Obstacle avoidance demo**: Run the `obstacle_avoidance.launch` file for a demo of obstacle avoidance.
3. **Object pick-and-place**: See the instructions in `examples/pick_and_place.md` for setting up and executing a pick-and-place task.
